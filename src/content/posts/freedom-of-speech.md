*If you can't criticize your government, you are not free.*

When I was working in China, I took the opportunity to play the brash American and ask my Chinese counterparts how they felt about the government. They all said something like, "I like the Chinese government. They could definitely do some things better, though. For example, housing is very expensive."

I was surprised they would say something even that critical! Turns out that economic answers about housing and wages are kind of acceptable answers to give to that question. So I pushed them, asking if they would feel comfortable saying something more negative about the government or its leaders.

It's hard to describe the look on their faces when I asked that question. I should clarify: I only broached this subject one-on-one in private places. We were completely alone, and yet, every single time, a kind of stricken look would cross their face as they shut their mouth tight and shook their head "no." 

They would quickly move to a new subject, and I didn't want to press what was clearly an uncomfortable and, in fact, taboo topic.

Not only can Chinese citizens not criticize their government, they can't talk about the fact that they can't criticize their government.

Our freedom of speech is something we often take for granted, but I'm so incredibly thankful for it. Go spend time somewhere that doesn't have that same freedom, carefully ask the right questions in the right way, and I suspect you'll come away with a similarly deep appreciation for this fundamental right we have. 

We don't have to be afraid.

To quote the 2005 masterpiece *V for Vendetta*: "People should not be afraid of their governments.Â Governments should be afraid of their people."
