**Convergence and Divergence** is a mental model for finding and pursuing new ideas: going from open-minded exploration to focused decision-making.

## Divergent Thinking: The Exploration Phase

Goal: explore new ideas and possibilities. Broaden your perspective by exploring various interests, skills, and opportunities.

Read widely, try new things, meet different people, and ask yourself what you enjoy and what matters to you. This is about generating options and getting to know and understand yourself better.

Throughout the process, write down ideas, thoughts, observations, possibilities, and solutions. The more the better.

### Divergent Thinking: How-to

**1. Brainstorm**
No idea is too outlandish. Use the "yes, and" framework from improv. Focus on quantity, not quality.

**2. Mind Map**
Explore the connections between ideas and topics.

**3. Questions**
Ask big, open-ended questions that will drive you forward and put you into the mindset of exploration.

**4. Learn New Skills**
Take classes. These don't have to be expensive, and there is no commitment. You don't need to become a proâ€”the point is to expose yourself to new things.

**5. Read, Write, and Talk**
Read about anything that interests you: books, blogs (heck, even watching YouTube videos). Just learn, write notes, and bring these into your brainstorming and mind maps.

Crucially, _talk to people_ about these concepts. Reach out to the authors, talk to the professor doing research, or email the CEO of the company. People are more accessible (and willing to help) than you might think.

**6. Teach**
Teach your friends about what you're learning. This helps to solidify concepts in your mind.


## Convergent Thinking: The Selection Phase

After a period of exploration, start narrowing down options based on what you learned about yourself and the world. Consider factors like your values, strengths, market demand, and your personal circumstances.

Make a decision based on which path best aligns with your overall life goals and aspirations.

This selection phase, by the end, should feel almost ruthless. You must choose the fewest possible paths forward and discard the rest. You must go from open-minded adventurer to laser-focused hunter.

### Convergent Thinking: How-To

**1. Determine Criteria**
Choose clear, measurable criteria for ranking ideas. These could be things like difficulty, ROI, or how well they align with your goals.

**2. Rank and Sort**
Rank your ideas based on the established criteria. Choose which ones to focus in on, and _forget the rest_. Consider giving these ideas away by publishing them on the Internet and letting others run with them.

**3. Refine**
Repeat steps 1 + 2 until you have a manageable list. Further develop the ideas to make sure they align with your goals and are possible to accomplish. Refine until you've found your selection.

Then, run with it!
